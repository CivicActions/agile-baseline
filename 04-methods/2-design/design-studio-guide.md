##Design Studio Guide

**What it is:**

Design Studio is a collaborative sketching exercise for the entire team. The result is rapid concept generation. The output of a design studio session is low-fidelity sketches and possibly wireframes.

**How to do it:**

It is the designer's responsibility to call these meetings and to facilitate them. In a typical session, teams sketch together, critique the work as it emerges, and converge on a solution they believe has the greatest chance at success. The designer then takes the ideas generated and produces designs.

**Why to do it:**

- Collaborative design builds shared understanding and increases feelings of ownership of the work being done
- Designing together increases the design IQ of the entire team
- It allows every member of the team to articulate her ideas
- It gives designers a much broader set of ideas to draw upon as they refine the UX
