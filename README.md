##CivicActions Agile Baseline

The Agile Baseline documents the principles, policies, processes, methods, and tools that underpin the way we do our work. This is a living document and is updated regularly. If you want to add or edit content in the Baseline, please submit a pull request or ask in [#agile](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/agile/).

Tip: the documentation in this repository can be used in combination with our [Agile Baseline story map](https://civicactions.storiesonboard.com/m/agile-baseline-story-map), which is also a living document.
